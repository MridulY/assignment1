-->Go to your profile on github.com
-->Click on "Repositories"
-->Click "New" towards the top-right of the screen
-->Give your repository a name. Avoid spaces and silly characters
-->Give your repository a description. Be as descriptive as you can, explain the purpose of the repository
-->Set your repository to "public" or "private," I suggest public unless required to keep with the spirit of GitHub
-->Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box unless you have already run git init in a directory via Terminal
-->If you know you want to ignore a specific code language, select it in the "Add .gitignore" dropbox, we can add specific folders and files to this later on
-->Give your repository a usage license. I suggest looking at this site; I prefer the MIT license
-->Click, "Create repository"
-->Clone your repository to your local machine
